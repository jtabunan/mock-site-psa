    <p><b>We cannot always control where our pets want to explore, and this is especially true during the cold winter seasons. Animals, whether they are strays or our own, need adequate housing to survive in receding temperatures. This guide will provide the basic tips, tricks, and tools necessary for accommodating for our furry friends outdoors.</b></p>

    <h2>Safety and Comfort!</h2>
    <p>The first consideration is determining the estimated temperatures that will be in effect during the days leading up to the cold front. Remember, most animals are born in the wild, but while they may have some resistances to the forces of nature it is never too safe to have a shelter for them to go back to.</p>
    <p>Your job is to actuate whether it may or may not be possible to relocate your animals indoors. Most domesticated pets already have their spots in the comforts of our homes, but it is important to consider the health of those that do stay outside too.</p>
    <p>Taking into consideration an animalâ€™s size, age, mass, and thickness are some of the factors that can determine what an animal may need for declining temperatures. It is crucial to keep in mind other weather elements besides just the temperature. Whiteouts and blizzards are especially dangerous for barn animals and strays.</p>

    <h2>Keep 'Em Cozy</h2>

    <p>Not all animals have the same needs, and this is especially important to remember when considering the needs for their housing outdoors. Most barn animals can withstand some bit of cold air, but to completely shut them out from it can be potentially harmful. It is important to check that there is adequate ventilation in their outdoor housing. Barn animals especially need that extra bit of air to keep out the bacteria and humidity that would otherwise build up inside the barn house.</p>
    <p>Every so often is it crucial that you clear out the harder ice that forms on the entrances and exits of their shelters. Animals and humans alike are prone to slipping on these obstacles, so it is important to shovel out the snow and debris when needed. Keeping their areas debris-free also ensures that during windier days and nights their shelters would be safe from flying objects.</p>

    <h2>...and Keep 'Em Fed!</h2>
    <p>Contrary to what you may think, animals need MORE food and water during the colder seasons. As the cold air flies in, the air tends to be dryer so there is less moisture for your furry friends to keep them hydrated. Diet changes might also be necessary as animals require more fatty proteins to keep their bodies warm and healthy. Every couple of hours it is important to check their food and water supplies to make sure that they are full, clean, and not frozen over. Be sure to place these resources in areas that are easily accessible to your animals.</p>

    <h2>Can You Do It Yourself?</h2>
    <p>Of course! Making a home for your animals can be easy, just be sure to do some further research into what materials are feasible for certain weather climates. It is important to weigh in the factors of protection, comfort, insulation, and cost when building a shelter. Find a resource that is easy or the most convenient for you to follow.</p>
