    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This infographic covers the information needed to understand and aid in the environment of outdoor animals during the colder seasons. It was made for people who care for the health and safety of the fuzzier friends outdoors, whether it be their own pets and animals or for those others who wander.</p>
    <p>I wanted to focus on the animals and outdoor environments of the winter seasons that undergoes snow. I used an assortment of cool toned and lighter colors to replicate the colors of snow, specifically in the areas of the heading and the images wrapped around the top and inside of the paragraphs. Since this project was more of a guide on how to maintain and create warm shelters for the animals outdoors, I added in an instructional video and a list of materials that could aid in the process of these creations. </p>
